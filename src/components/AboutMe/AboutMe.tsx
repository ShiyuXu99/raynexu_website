                My name is Shiyu (Rayne) Xu. I am currently a software engineer working at Moderna. Previously, I earned my Masterâ€™s degree from the University of Michigan - Ann Arborâ€™s School of Information, focusing on the Human-Computer Interaction track. I also earned a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin - Madison, with minors in Mathematics and Graphic Design. During my Masterâ€™s, I was lucky to have Prof. Steve Oney as my advisor for research and thesis, and I was fortunate to work with Prof. Yaxing Yao as a research assistant.

                My research interest lies in human-computer interaction, specifically in designing technology that better understands and facilitates human needs, in the areas of mental health and education.
